Stakeholder Management: A concept review of its application

Freeman (1984) - Stakeholder Management could be summarized as the organization’s ability to identify who its stakeholders are and their respective interests, objectives, and ability to influence the organization, to understand the processes that may be used by the organization to relate to these stakeholders, and to deduce what decisions best allow the stakeholder interests to be aligned with the organization’s processes

Buysse and Verbeke (2003) - The modern stakeholder management approach thus suggests that corporations should not narrowly focus their strategic management decisions on creating shareholder value. They should broaden their objectives to address the expectations and interests of a wide variety of salient stakeholders. Such objectives may include customer satisfaction, regulatory compliance, good corporate citizenship, and social and environmental responsibility among others.

Harrison, Bosse and Phillips (2010) - Brings the concept of how managing for stakeholders unlocks knowledge about stakeholder utility functions and how this knowledge can lead to value-creation opportunities what is likely to lead to a competitive advantage
